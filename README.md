# Europe_Airbnb_Analysis
# Motivation: 
The analysis findings can help individuals make better decisions when searching for Airbnb rentals while traveling. It aims to assist them in determining key factors that may affect the Airbnb price, thereby increasing the chance of finding an affordable listing.
# Data Source and Limitation: 
The datasets include ten big cities (Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Berlin, Budapest, Lisbon, London, Paris, Rome, Vienna). The final dataset has 16 variables and 51707 observations.
Given the propensity of Airbnb pricing to oscillate with seasonal variations or other influential factors, a dataset limited to a particular time frame may not faithfully capture these dynamics.
